## Machine Learning Pipelines
Machine learning Pipelines are a series of steps that automate the process of transforming raw data into a machine learning model. They help in managing the complexity of machine learning workflows, ensuring reproducibility, and facilitating collaboration.

## Key Components of a Machine Learning Process
1. Download the data - Ingestion
2. Transform the data - Filtering & Removing outliers
3. Preprocessing data for ML - X, y
4. Hyperparameter tuning - Best parameters
5. Train the final model
